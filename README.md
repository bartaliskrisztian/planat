# Planat

Summer internship project 2020.
Planat is a single page web application (SPA) written in reactJS. The user can search for any kind of place all over the world, according to his/her interest.
Google Places API is used to retrieve the information about the places.

It's useful for the users who:
* want to explore new places
* want to visit places which can have interest in
* don't have concrete destination
* want to try out new things
